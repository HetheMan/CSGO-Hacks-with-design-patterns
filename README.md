# CSGO-Hacks-with-design-patterns

## What is this?

It's a wallhack made in c++ using the Command design pattern to call for READ, WRITE functions and finally the Wallhack or Bunnyhop hack.

## What else should I know?

This hack uses non-auto-updated offsets, if you want it to work you should update them with new ones.
